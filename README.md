# Smart Waste Sorter
Building AI course project

## Summary
An AI-powered system that helps people sort waste into correct recycling bins using image recognition.

## Background
People often throw recyclable items into the wrong bin, causing environmental harm. This project aims to reduce waste contamination using AI.

## Data and AI techniques
The model uses image data of waste items (plastic, paper, metal, etc.). I plan to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify items into categories.

## How is it used
It can be used via a mobile app. The user takes a photo of the item, and the app tells them the correct bin.

## Challenges
It may struggle with rare items or poor lighting. Data collection might be time-consuming.

## What next
The app could expand to support more regions and languages, and improve accuracy over time.

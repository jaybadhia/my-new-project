# EcoVoice: An AI Assistant for Sustainable Living
Building AI course project

## Summary
EcoVoice is a voice-activated AI assistant designed to help individuals adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives. It provides real-time eco-friendly tips, tracks household carbon footprints, and recommends personalized actions to reduce environmental impact.

## Background
Climate change and environmental degradation are among the most pressing global issues. Many people want to live more sustainably but lack the guidance or tools to do so effectively. My motivation is rooted in seeing the everyday waste and inefficiencies in households and realizing that small behavioral changes can make a big difference if supported by accessible technology.

## Data and AI Techniques
EcoVoice will rely on multiple data sources:
- Energy consumption data (via smart meters or manual input)
- Grocery purchase history (if connected to store loyalty accounts or scanned receipts)
- Daily voice inputs about activities (e.g., "I took a 15-minute shower")

The project will use:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for understanding voice commands
- **Reinforcement Learning** to improve recommendations over time
- **Classification and Regression Models** to predict CO₂ impact and suggest actions

Example: If the user says “I bought a plastic water bottle today,” EcoVoice might respond, “Consider using a reusable bottle. You could save 120 kg of CO₂ a year.”

## How is it used
EcoVoice is used through a smart speaker, phone app, or wearable device. It listens to users' habits and gives real-time suggestions. It might also connect with smart home devices (e.g., thermostats, lights) to automate energy savings.

Primary users:
- Environmentally conscious individuals
- Families looking to teach kids sustainable habits
- Urban dwellers with high carbon footprints

## Challenges
- **Privacy concerns**: Voice data must be protected
- **Data quality**: Self-reported habits can be inaccurate
- **Behavior change**: Users may ignore or resist suggestions
- **Hardware integration**: Not all users have smart homes

## What next
The project can be scaled by:
- Partnering with energy companies and green NGOs
- Creating a “Sustainability Score” users can share
- Integrating with local recycling/waste management data
- Adding gamification (e.g., challenges, achievements)

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by the Elements of AI course and tools like Google Assistant and EcoBuddy. Open-source NLP libraries (like spaCy and BERT) would be used for building the prototype. Data sources could include EPA and UN sustainability reports.

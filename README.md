# Project Title (e.g., Smart Waste Sorter)
Building AI course project

## Summary
An AI-powered image classifier that helps users sort waste correctly into recycling categories using a smartphone camera.  
(This summary should be about 250 characters.)

## Background
Explain the problem (e.g., people often confuse recycling categories), its scale, and your motivation to solve it.

## Data and AI techniques
Mention your data source (e.g., labeled images of trash) and AI method (e.g., image classification using CNNs).

## How is it used
Describe who will use it (e.g., households or city waste departments) and in what context.

## Challenges
Mention any limitations (e.g., poor accuracy in low light, model bias, etc.).

## What next
Talk about possible future improvements (e.g., adding multilingual support, integrating with waste apps).

## Acknowledgments
Give credit to any datasets, libraries, mentors, or inspirations you used.
